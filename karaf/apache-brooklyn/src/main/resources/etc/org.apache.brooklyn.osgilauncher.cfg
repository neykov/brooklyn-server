# This file temporarily contains boot settings for brooklyn karaf launcher,
# matching some of the command-line options of the previous brooklyn-cli launcher
# (those used during the initialization sequence)
#
# Most of these will migrate to a permanent cfg file, once the components themselves get refactored
# and the configuration options are agreed upon


# Ignore catalog subsystem failures during startup (default is to continue, so errors can be viewed via the API)
#ignoreCatalogErrors=true

# Ignore persistence/HA subsystem failures during startup (default is to continue, so errors can be viewed via the API)
#ignorePersistenceErrors=true

# The high availability mode. Possible values are:
# - disabled: management node works in isolation - will not cooperate with any other standby/master nodes in management plane;
# - auto: will look for other management nodes, and will allocate itself as standby or master based on other nodes' states;
# - master: will startup as master - if there is already a master then fails immediately;
# - standby: will start up as lukewarm standby with no state - if there is not already a master then fails immediately,
#   and if there is a master which subsequently fails, this node can promote itself;
# - hot_standby: will start up as hot standby in read-only mode - if there is not already a master then fails immediately,
#   and if there is a master which subseuqently fails, this node can promote itself;
# - hot_backup: will start up as hot backup in read-only mode - no master is required, and this node will not become a master
#highAvailabilityMode=disabled

# The persistence mode. Possible values are:
# - disabled: will not read or persist any state;
# - auto: will rebind to any existing state, or start up fresh if no state;
# - rebind: will rebind to the existing state, or fail if no state available;
# - clean: will start up fresh (removing any existing state)
#persistMode=disabled

# The directory to read/write persisted state (or container name if using an object store)
#persistenceDir=

# The location spec for an object store to read/write persisted state
#persistenceLocation=

# Periodic read-only rebind
#persistPeriod=1s
